Pull Changes from the Remote Repository
First, make sure you're on the branch where you want to merge the changes.
For example, if you want to merge changes into the main branch:

git checkout main
git pull origin main

Merge Changes from Another Branch
If you want to merge changes from another branch (let's say feature-branch) into main:

git merge feature-branch


git add .

git commit -m "Merged feature-branch into main"

Push Changes to the Remote Repository:
git push origin main
